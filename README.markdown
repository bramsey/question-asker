# Question Asker

This tool helps you answer questions about each thing in a list of stuff.  It's meant to be easier and quicker to use than fiddling around with a spreadsheet or checking things off in a text editor to achieve the same results.

## How to use

Paste a list of stuff into the big text area on the main page, then follow the directions to answer yes/no questions about each of the items in the list.  Make sure that you put one item per line in the list to ensure the expected results.

Once you've answered the question for each item in the list, the tool will present you with two new lists: one for "yes", another for "no".
